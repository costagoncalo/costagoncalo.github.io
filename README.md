### Website made from Jekflix

A theme for Jekyll inspired by Netflix panel for who loves movies and series and would like to have a blog with this cool appearance.

I started this project with the aim of learning how a website works and how everything is connected in the construction process while at the same time solving an inconvenience that I have encountered on a daily basis: I can never have the recipes I like most in a single place. This website will solve that problem and will also allow me to share my favorite recipes with other people!
