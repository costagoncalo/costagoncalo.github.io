### Ingredients:  

* 14 ounces (397 g) extra firm tofu  
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch  
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil  
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil  

### For the sauce:  

* ¼ cup (59 ml) low-sodium soy sauce  
* ¼ cup (59 ml) water  
* 2 teaspoons honey  
* 1 ½ teaspoons sambal oelek, (if you like it less spicy, stick with 1 teaspoon)  
* 1 teaspoon garlic paste, (see notes)  
* ½ teaspoon rice wine vinegar  
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch  

### Instructions:   
**1.** Place two paper towels on a plate then place the entire block of tofu (drained from its packaging liquid) onto the plate. Place two more paper towels on top of the tofu then put a heavy item on top. Not TOO heavy that it would completely crush the tofu but heavy enough that it can squeeze out liquid. (I like using a cast iron skillet.)  
Leave the tofu to drain for 30 minutes and halfway through, change out the paper towels.  
ALTERNATIVELY and more eco-friendly: place a wire baking rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet. Place tofu on top and then put a heavy object on top and let drain for 30 minutes.  
**2.** Once the tofu has drained, slice in half then into cubes and place into a large bowl. Sprinkle cornstarch on top and gently toss with your hands to ensure all tofu pieces are covered.  
**3.** In a large skillet, add sesame oil and vegetable oil then bring up to medium-high heat.  
**4.** Once oil is heated up, add the tofu to the skillet and let brown on all sides.  
**5.** In the meantime, whisk together the ingredients for the sauce.  
**6.** Once the tofu has browned and crisped up on all sides, add the sauce to the skillet and it should start to thicken immediately. Toss the tofu around to coat then remove from heat.  
**7.** Serve and enjoy!  

### Notes:  

* Sesame seeds and scallions are a garnish. You can add them if you want but they were mainly added for aesthetic reasons.  
* A note on sesame oil and vegetable oil: Some readers have commented that sesame oil has a low smoke point and should not be used to cook/fry. While I haven’t had issues with smoking/burning, I have adjusted the recipe to use 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil in conjunction with vegetable oil to help with the smoking points. You can omit the vegetable oil and use only sesame oil if you want. It depends on what you’re comfortable with.  
* Use garlic paste. You aren’t cooking the sauce for long, and if you use fresh garlic then it may still be raw and have a bite to it. However, you are more than welcome to use 1 clove of freshly minced garlic instead!
